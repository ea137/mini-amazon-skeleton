"1111","79","694","1","Building on 150 years and six generations of winemaking tradition, the winery trends toward a leaner style, with the classic California buttercream aroma cut by tart green apple.

"1637","22","919","1","Poached pears, yellow apples and a touch of butter show on the classic nose of this Chardonnay that holds to steely frame.

"860","91","810","2","Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here.

Very long, juicy, lingering finish.","1985-02-26 20:22:16"
"276","81","547","3","Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.","1984-05-11 22:04:23"
"1291","75","173","5","The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine.

"725","28","770","0","Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.","1975-07-12 23:15:42"
"560","9","733","0","The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.","1987-02-22 11:25:20"
"766","23","981","4","This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.","2020-01-04 14:44:07"
"1567","10","270","0","Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense.

Very balanced.","2000-07-30 14:36:44"
"411","99","280","3","A big, black bruiser of a wine that has black olive flavors and aromas and plenty beyond. Raspberry, mulberry, vanilla and spice all vie on the nose, while the palate is so dark it¬¥s tough to discern the plum and leather flavors. Give it three years and reap the benefits.","1982-09-06 00:29:08"
"283","37","324","5","At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish. Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure.","2006-10-26 09:33:12"
"679","20","855","1","Attractive mid-gold color. Compelling layers of tangy citrus and stone fruit aromas with notes of honey and earthy minerality.

Taut and focused.","1996-12-02 09:14:46"
"275","75","868","3","A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure. Flavors of cassis underly this, while the wood spices contribute their ribbon of flavor.

"1712","40","34","3","Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage. Big rich, fat with smoked meat and a good dose of oak, the wine was one of the few that didn't peter out early but stayed on the palate to the end, culminating in an nice easy finish.","1976-03-08 17:58:12"
"679","87","298","1","Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.","2005-08-09 11:24:24"
"1591","36","789","1","The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant. The nose is complex, showing licorice, summer fruits, caramel and roses. On the palate, it is soft and pleasant, but lacks some concentration.  At its peak, but will drink well for a few years.","2013-03-13 16:23:46"
"227","78","431","4","This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune‚Äîno doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now‚Äì2020. Imported by Acadia Imports.","2012-07-30 21:26:41"

"1470","15","31","4","A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor.","1975-11-12 04:52:36"
"1565","59","976","0","This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish.","2001-01-14 17:06:53"
"113","5","924","1","A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it.","2004-09-02 13:23:02"
"1354","47","420","5","Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish.","1979-10-16 00:56:18"
"686","23","766","4","Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023.","1981-03-14 10:19:44"

"874","66","251","5","There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas.

"936","52","331","0","Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.","1970-03-28 18:14:02"
"703","82","264","3","Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019.","2007-04-11 10:27:44"
"202","25","308","1","Smashed blackberry and blueberry fruit are enhanced by burned caramel, heavy slate and touches of soy and smoke on the nose.

Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.","1974-11-04 13:24:15"
"1896","62","907","5","Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla.

"1104","44","375","5","Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.","1976-03-31 06:10:22"
"1104","93","663","3","Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb.

"465","53","63","5","Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018.","1972-09-22 09:27:50"
"554","5","800","4","A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper.

"1931","2","73","0","More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose.

"1541","82","582","4","Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926.","1987-10-13 03:33:11"
"422","2","822","1","This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits.

"756","42","556","3","Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well.

"645","74","221","1","The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose.

"1186","34","126","0","This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.","2021-12-07 02:40:39"
"1157","35","199","3","Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines.

"673","19","367","3","Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.","1973-06-19 06:36:53"

"1570","11","326","1","Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.","2000-02-25 04:18:33"
"1329","84","711","4","The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.","1981-09-02 06:53:03"
"59","3","197","0","This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.","1989-08-28 15:51:42"
"254","38","340","5","Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.","1988-01-22 01:52:18"
"758","2","728","3","Loaded with bold, ripe fruit, exotic spice and leather, this is a simple but genuine expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes thick and a bit chunky in the mouth because of its chewy, succulent tannins.","1993-07-08 21:42:53"
"571","76","235","1","With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torront√©s that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torront√©s should be. Drink now.","2011-12-02 04:56:51"
"1773","79","684","2","This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.","1975-11-12 07:24:34"
"979","31","234","5","Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmen√®re (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.","2000-02-29 08:07:14"
"641","52","972","3","This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.","1971-10-04 04:02:56"
"1942","85","570","2","This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge‚Äîalmost too much‚Äîemphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.","1970-09-11 16:57:14"
"476","17","379","4","Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now.","1983-03-25 01:05:59"
"981","16","2","4","Clean and honest up front, with moderate richness and modest telltale Casablanca pineapple aromas. The plate is creamier than many wines in this price range, with flavors of apple cider, citrus and some pith. Overall this is a good value wine with enough citrus and acidity to qualify it as fresh.","1992-05-24 08:50:10"
"804","0","405","3","Chocolate, espresso, plum and black currant are backed by smoky nuances and natural rubber. This muscular wine offers polished tannins and firm structure to the end. A bit of wine from the 2005 and 2006 vintages is blended in.","1982-01-30 21:08:03"
"1013","80","99","0","From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling‚Äîan easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.","1979-06-23 16:32:24"
"279","96","44","2","Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent.","1997-04-11 22:38:45"
"1830","16","479","2","A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.","2008-12-23 03:06:17"
"1150","53","714","0","Here's a traditional Chianti Classico with pretty aromas of cherry cola, mesquite, almonds and violets. The wine is compact and elegant in the mouth and offers crisp berry flavors on the close.","1980-08-20 06:42:28"
"182","78","169","1","This is a mature, jammy wine with thick layers of plum, prune and raisin. The wine's appearance is dark and concentrated and that same sensation of heaviness carries over the palate in the form of black currant and spice. The tannins are firm and tart.","2017-07-31 12:58:18"
"721","54","597","0","Pancole is a pretty expression of Tuscany's popular Vernaccia di San Gimignano with a luminous, bright appearance and pristine aromas of stone and passion fruits. The wine is lean and tonic with spicy notes on the finish.","1980-03-02 21:12:14"
"509","40","175","0","This is a concentrated, fairly full and lush Chenin, rich in toasty oak and vanilla cream as well as notes of baked apple pie and sweet orange. The medium-weight palate is mouthfilling and satisfying, with ample acidity to lift the decadent flavors. Notes of clove, anise and toasted nuts mingle on the lingering finish. Drink now‚Äì2019.","2002-03-21 17:27:42"
"683","30","613","2","This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes.","1983-10-26 00:03:58"
"1591","36","646","4","This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure.","1971-08-21 23:05:26"
"247","64","860","4","Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, tobacco and dark spice lead the way. The rounded palate offers dried cherry, raspberry, coffee and a licorice note alongside velvety if not very persistent tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is evolving quickly so enjoy over the next several years.","2013-11-05 06:27:30"
"1593","20","747","2","Made with 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, this boasts appealing aromas of acacia flower, nectarine and Alpine herb. The elegant palate delivers juicy Gala apple, yellow peach and a touch of ginger alongside fresh acidity.","2014-11-03 17:02:33"
"1388","7","676","5","This wine features pleasing aromas of raspberry, jumper berry and black pepper. There is a nice m√©lange of fruit and spice flavors, notably black cherry, dark plums, anise, and cardamom. Smooth tannins ply the palate right into a bright finish that bears a touch of salinity.","1970-04-14 02:45:44"
"44","91","544","4","A year in wood and 30 months in bottle before release have allowed this attractive wine to fully develop its solid yet smooth texture. It has concentration, layers of bright black currant fruit and vibrant acidity. Ready to drink.","2016-11-13 01:08:04"
"1859","0","353","0","This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rh√¥ne varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors.","2009-06-16 11:04:34"
"296","72","679","0","Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish.","1976-06-20 12:37:20"
"584","82","475","0","This is an extraordiary deal for a solidly built, high-level wine. It offers succulent cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors, wrapped in approachable, mellowed tannin and oak.","2004-05-05 05:00:09"
"1203","44","329","5","Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice.","2011-11-16 22:13:01"
"1593","82","407","2","A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% S√©millon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now‚Äì2019.","1999-02-01 05:37:58"
"945","99","290","3","Intriguing, thought provoking and complex, this wine starts off with perfumed aromas of thyme, bay leaf and lavender. It's supple in the mouth and silky in feel, imbued with black cherry and blueberry fruit, then shows a hint of adhesive bandage on the finish. Drink now.","1984-12-06 17:37:31"
"871","44","40","1","This leads with clean yet soft scents of ripe apple, Anjoy pear and orange blossom. Those notes carry through to the medium-weight palate, well integrated with soft toasted-oak tones. It's harmonious and balanced, with ample acidity lending good lift through the close. Drink now.","2008-04-29 19:24:04"
"116","74","829","5","This is taut and sinewy in profile, but shows off a fine range of aromas, from thyme and lavender to cocoa, red plum and ripe cherry. The raspberry and herb flavors finish in a storm of firm tannins. Drink 2020‚Äì2025.","2006-11-07 07:33:44"
"1283","95","640","0","Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.","1988-07-03 09:43:25"
"1777","4","339","1","This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, cr√®me de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.","1987-08-10 23:34:44"
"948","5","935","2","This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourv√®dre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.","2016-09-07 00:58:49"
"1506","35","749","2","Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish.","1993-08-28 06:53:42"
"948","5","274","3","Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019‚Äì2025.","2006-01-31 22:12:58"
"1420","82","328","1","Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.","2013-11-08 20:38:30"
"426","44","60","4","Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% S√©millon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.","1978-05-10 21:40:36"
"32","92","143","5","From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.","1980-12-26 05:03:19"
"1866","20","500","5","Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.","2000-03-03 12:40:59"
"1348","33","111","2","This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.","2012-11-19 05:26:26"
"469","33","268","3","Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018‚Äì2023.","2015-03-21 03:10:54"
"1401","94","364","1","Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish.","2006-03-04 18:41:05"
"189","64","658","1","Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.","1970-12-09 13:41:59"
"484","83","309","2","There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.","1991-05-19 14:18:55"
"1130","56","889","0","This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now.","2001-05-10 02:21:34"
"1941","77","831","4","The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.","1987-01-22 12:35:17"
"1173","78","114","5","A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.","1980-10-12 13:05:50"
"496","18","204","1","Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rh√¥ne wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.","1986-06-09 23:16:24"
"1227","97","398","0","Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gew√ºrtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.","2001-11-28 06:04:58"
"963","88","737","1","Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.","2002-01-13 07:39:59"
"1132","65","5","2","Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.","1999-11-15 09:24:38"
"1870","65","988","3","There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.","1999-07-17 18:50:59"
"254","38","269","0","Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous ros√© eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.","1979-11-28 16:59:56"
"976","89","675","3","Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.","2011-12-16 01:18:35"
"729","5","10","2","Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.","1975-05-14 10:40:47"
"1318","25","391","1","The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture.","1997-03-10 10:01:03"
"266","11","84","1","The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down‚Äîbig and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.","1973-04-05 09:02:52"
"1203","9","852","4","A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.","2020-08-30 21:40:58"
"1956","31","778","0","Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.","1985-01-24 00:25:13"
"1415","42","595","3","Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.","1975-11-30 11:01:09"
"31","24","863","2","Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.","2018-08-31 15:49:33"
"1096","27","796","1","This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.","1983-05-13 07:29:31"
"1163","30","118","0","Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.","2019-03-28 23:23:41"
"1237","56","67","0","Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.","1994-08-06 07:58:51"
"741","39","628","1","Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.","1982-03-12 22:58:36"
"23","48","19","5","Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.","1985-07-29 14:11:02"
"1410","28","716","0","This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.","1989-09-15 08:38:18"
"374","61","788","3","Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.","2002-07-28 19:20:07"
"1096","7","773","5","Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.","1990-11-15 11:27:00"
"806","22","170","4","Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors‚Äîtomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.","2011-06-03 07:26:50"
"80","18","954","3","Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.","1984-04-29 07:32:00"
"404","53","485","3","Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.","1997-03-12 20:30:09"
"1470","87","719","4","The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.","1998-05-23 05:53:39"
"1900","58","256","1","Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.","2010-09-21 10:52:20"
"71","74","963","1","A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry. Fine, dusty tannins reminiscent of cocoa powder and dried crushed berries stay after swallow alongside a hint of sweet smoke flavor.","1976-11-27 19:27:07"
"808","85","78","0","This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.","1996-11-25 05:24:32"
"1800","43","816","1","This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla. Rich blackberry and cassis flavors flood the palate, but then transition to sweet smoke and oak flavors on the finish.","1991-07-13 02:34:18"
"567","23","780","1","Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2‚Äì3 years, the wine will always be firm.","1981-03-10 16:03:12"
"1168","27","513","3","Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.","1974-08-12 12:16:31"
"663","3","910","3","A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.","1992-08-03 23:23:04"
"1464","60","746","0","Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.","1974-10-27 16:08:07"

"56","43","419","4","A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat. Medium weight and lush, the creamy mouth transitions into a finish loaded with sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa.","1970-02-22 00:39:57"
"1335","25","205","3","Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche. Medium weight in the mouth with good balance and a touch of baking spice on the close.","1986-09-01 09:34:51"

Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.","2012-04-21 09:55:53"

"131","58","797","3","Lively aromas of lemon, grapefruit and melon start this white from Greece. Flavors of grapefruit and lemon rind are fresh and crisp but still offer dimension. The finish is spicy and clean. A great food wine: pair with grilled fish or clams.","1991-05-28 05:01:30"
"1416","92","651","0","This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time.

"1896","43","845","3","A huge, kick butt Zinfandel, packed with sweet berry, bacon, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors. There's absolutely nothing shy about it. Packs a real punch all the way through to the spicy finish. Good price for a Sonoma Zin this classic.","1987-03-11 12:50:41"
"1141","79","64","4","Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors.","1988-03-08 00:21:40"

"1905","98","742","0","A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character.

"258","95","761","2","This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.","2002-10-05 05:49:57"

The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.","2015-02-08 16:05:27"
"195","86","233","4","This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.","1987-07-19 07:28:43"
"673","3","996","1","This is a very aromatic wine that's rich, spicy and with just a touch of ripeness. It has spiced pear, lychee and honey notes all balanced by a wonderful fresh acidity. Drink now and until 2020. Screwcap.","1998-02-26 05:59:08"

"1712","17","194","1","This is the stud in the Ac√∫stic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, Bra√≥ is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas.

"635","28","179","2","This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors.

"302","1","33","4","This is a wine that has great potential‚Äîyou can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture.

"756","42","8","0","This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.","1982-01-09 21:23:43"
"813","35","478","1","Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power.

"182","78","666","4","Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.","1977-10-19 18:16:19"
"1919","15","601","1","A good, clean, tart and lightly spicy all-stainless style. Cool climate fruit puts the accent on lime and lemon flavors, keeps the alcohol low (13.3%), and makes this a fine match to shellfish, white fish and light pasta dishes.","2005-11-23 01:48:04"
"863","24","363","4","This fresh Nebbiolo-based Roero from Cantina dei Nebbiolo offers pretty intensity with aromas of tar, licorice and a touch of sweet cherry liqueur. There isn't much pulp or meat here but the finish is both crisp and tart.","2004-05-15 04:05:37"
"1807","78","85","2","Slightly disjointed at first, this Barolo with fruit sourced from four vineyard sites, needs a few minutes to open in the glass. The wine offers tertiary aromas of cured beef, smoked bacon and white mushroom. Drink now.","1978-09-09 02:46:45"

"355","85","427","1","Here's a fun and slightly less formal expression of Nebbiolo (especially when compared to the great wines of Barbaresco and Barolo) that offers tight fruit nuances of white cherry and forest berry backed by light shadings of spice and smoke.","2018-06-26 02:32:00"
"768","48","92","3","Aged 12 months in large oak casks, this bright Nebbiolo offers pretty aromas of small berry, tar, licorice and cigar smoke backed by tight intensity and structure. Pair this powerful wine with braised quail or pork tenderloin.","1981-10-05 22:40:25"
"443","7","567","2","This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor. It's peppery and meaty upfront, filled out on the midpalate by tart fruit that verges on cranberry in flavor. Pretty rather than potent; drink now-2014.","2009-02-03 07:36:07"
"888","21","858","1","A good wine to drink now for its sweet, ripe berry and mocha flavors and smoky coat of oak. It has smooth tannins and a spicy finish. Give it a good decant to let it breathe for a few hours.","1991-02-04 02:37:21"
"262","70","725","1","Roero Rabino is accented by sweet touches of cinnamon and nutmeg that are offset by cassis, dried blueberry, leather and tobacco. This sturdy red wine presents a very nice ensemble that is capped by a tight, astringent close.","1987-04-01 09:50:30"
"1902","91","482","4","With rich, sweet blackberry and cocoa flavors, this is a very nice Cabernet for drinking with a good meal. It's a little rough around the edges, with jaggy tannins. Ready now.","1983-06-01 04:56:28"

"1989","86","806","4","An intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle, which highlights the herbaceous Sauvignon character and a more perfumed Muscadelle. The two give a fresh, citrus- and pineapple-flavored wine, lively, to be enjoyed young.","1993-09-27 04:52:17"
"301","56","334","3","Soft, ripe, dominated by peaches, pears and a rounded, toasty character. The spice is dominant, giving the wine an exotic edge. The more rounded style gives concentration as well as a fine, finishing velvet texture.","1971-09-02 00:37:55"
"1170","23","928","4","Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.","2000-10-26 12:08:07"
"247","75","260","5","Paladin produces a luminous and fresh Prosecco from the northeast of Italy with tonic aromas of peach, white stone and citrus fruit. It's an easy-drinking wine that would wash down well with appetizers and informal finger foods.","1979-09-04 15:40:49"
"1805","62","94","0","Soapy aromas of bee's wax and lavender open the nose of this luminous sparkler and are followed by dried flowers and hay.

"1134","73","54","3","This Brut interpretation of Prosecco (‚ÄúBrut‚Äù means it tastes dry in the mouth) offers tangy fizz and soda-like intensity backed by subdued aromas of white mineral and stone fruit. Pair it with puff pastry appetizers.","2011-03-10 07:57:08"

"1119","95","241","5","Mildly minty and woody on the nose, with grass, wintergreen and cheese aromas as well as red fruit. The palate is tight and grabby, with a blast of citric acid that gives the plum and raspberry flavors a tart, decidedly ‚Äúred‚Äù personality. Snappy and crisp on the finish, making it a fresh, lean style of Cabernet.","2015-03-13 05:17:13"
"777","59","214","4","The wine's golden hue tells you this is Prosecco from a warmer climate (Conegliano is a few degrees warmer than Valdobbiadene) as do its aromas of mature peach and honeysuckle. The wine tastes flat and big in the mouth and offers sophisticated notes of white pepper and spice.","1972-08-20 21:10:42"
"645","74","232","1","This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone.","1997-08-16 13:02:02"
"1718","81","705","5","Drying mineral tones face off with luscious peach flavors to create a well-balanced Extra Dry Prosecco sparkler. The bubbly offers cheerful foaming in the mouth and sweet fruit flavors on the close.","1986-12-04 00:30:36"
"1763","2","703","3","Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.","1974-01-26 00:39:59"
"1961","15","220","0","This New World blend of Sauvignon Blanc, S√©millon, Chardonnay and Viognier is very fruity. It offers a blast of pineapples, honeysuckles, peaches and figs, with a coating of oaky, vanilla buttercream.","2001-01-24 11:38:43"

"1463","52","671","5","This Rh√¥ne-style blend is a little rustic and sharp in tannins and acids. It shows a polished core of jammy blackberries, cherries and spices, and could develop in a year or two.","2004-06-10 01:04:12"
"1432","8","531","0","Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gew√ºrztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun.

"1783","91","182","2","This crisp sparkler is characterized by drying mineral tones and delicate aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The wine is foamy and slightly sweet in the mouth and does an excellent job of representing this category of Italian wine.","2007-04-28 09:44:30"
"860","83","337","2","A ripe, fruity wine that takes its raspberry flavor from the color. The wine has softness, a creamy character that rounds out any acidity, leaving a smooth, fruity finish.","1990-05-15 10:17:54"
"1048","56","377","3","There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn. The bubbling seems less frothy and the wine has a flat, big feel in the mouth. Grapes were farmed organically and the wine is from the 2007 vintage, which may explain its distinctive style.","1993-02-22 11:36:08"
"1714","8","869","5","Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.","1998-03-30 14:01:55"
"1301","31","655","3","An easy and inviting selection, there's a mentholated streak to the soft red currant and cherry core of this wine. Light and breezy on the palate, it offers thin, quickly dissipating flavors and a fleeting finish.","1982-07-28 03:25:59"
"1557","88","926","0","The wine is earthy and somewhat rustic. There is fruit but it is spoiled by a spicy pepper edge. Chill this drastically.","1973-10-08 14:02:59"

"1877","73","543","0","The nose is muted, despite the slight spritz of the wine, while the palate is equally toned down. It's a rounded if not very expressive white wine.","1980-04-30 16:04:28"
"107","75","127","0","Plummy and hinting at black cherry, this wine is otherwise soft and simple, with a distracting, full-throttled descent into raisin cake and prune.","1982-12-20 23:23:56"
"1164","29","603","5","Funky, yeasty aromas of cinnamon, spent lees and bread yeast dominate the nose. This feels foamy, with lightly vegetal flavors of apple that finish briny.","1978-08-18 06:24:14"
"47","62","854","5","Jumpy on the nose at first, but then green tea and grassy aromas take over. This PN is what it is: it tastes grassy, leafy and like green beans. Vegetal notes carry over to the finish.","1993-05-25 09:26:04"
"1848","15","168","4","Aromas of pumpkin, squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting. There's an acceptable mouthfeel to this weird, unbalanced Chardonnay along with flavors of spiced squash, mealy apple and saut√©ed root vegetables.","2002-07-01 18:02:27"
"1750","27","550","4","This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.","1999-05-31 01:16:58"
"663","99","13","3","This deep brown wine smells like a damp, mossy cave. Then add complex rancio notes, plus maple syrup and molasses. It's full, round and harmonious, wonderfully rich yet without any sense of heaviness and long and bright on the finish.","1995-09-19 08:43:03"
"456","43","792","3","Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.","2013-11-18 20:46:51"
"49","47","634","2","Deep mahogany. Dried fig and black tea on the nose, then concentrated mocha and molasses flavors, enlivened by candied orange zest. Full, rich and sweet, but surprisingly drinkable, with terrific intensity and length.","1994-07-29 02:00:58"
"259","17","957","2","RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums.

"383","77","953","2","This amber-colored Hungarian stunner has ethereal aromas of raw honey, beeswax, freshly baked tarte Tatin, canned apricot and fresh pear. It is silky smooth and creamy in the mouth with pronounced flavors of clover honey, pear tart and baked sweet apples. The acidity is perfectly balanced so you can appreciate its velvety richness without feeling that the sweetness is too cloying.","1997-02-10 15:26:21"
"811","52","741","2","Citrus-kissed saltiness lies at the core of this incredibly delicious, deliriously crafted wine, from the great grape grower in the heart of the Russian River Valley. Beautifully crisp, it lingers in stony minerality and a freshness of apricot, memorable from first sip to last.","2020-10-31 07:36:27"
"771","31","161","0","This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024.","1970-02-17 09:51:49"
"665","17","604","0","Whiffs of white mushroom, saffron and caramel lend complexity to this concentrated elixir of apricots and orange peels. It's honeyed and sweet but vivaciously balanced, glazing the palate in ethereal textures of gossamer and tulle. The caramel finish lingers endlessly.","1975-01-06 12:50:10"
"679","54","875","3","A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.","1971-11-15 23:37:33"
"229","92","311","1","Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same‚Äîdark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.","1990-12-06 01:07:08"
"870","58","196","5","Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future. The wood aging is already surrounded by ripe, intense black fruits. A fresher character comes from the bright acidity of the vintage, giving the wine a lift. The aftertaste is long and concentrated. Drink from 2024.","1971-12-07 18:48:31"
"964","23","677","0","Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.","1971-05-02 19:26:37"
"1658","23","819","5","Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve). This poised wine is both stylish and rich, with good acidity allied to ripe apple and citrus fruits, cut through the mineral texture and promise a generous wine as it ages. Drink from 2020.","2004-06-07 06:51:45"
"949","64","538","2","Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now‚Äì2030.","2001-04-09 07:09:36"
"872","82","625","5","Enticing scents of ripe berry, underbrush, grilled herb and eucalyptus mingle together along with an underlying fragrance of rose petal.

"379","10","717","2","As impressive as the woman‚Äîa pioneer in the Napa Valley‚Äîwas herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022.","1994-02-28 22:47:49"
"1318","55","259","1","This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas.

"1535","77","344","0","For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.","2020-04-21 04:39:12"
"1380","45","155","4","The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky‚Äîfull of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut‚Äîbut there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now‚Äì2025.","1999-05-21 22:00:45"
"201","37","969","2","This spends 12 months in oak and it shows: It offers aromas of liquid smoke and flavors of brown sugar, honey and caramel. The fruit is subdued, leaving the emphasis on the oak and mineral components. Try with rich but delicately flavored fish dishes or mild ch√®vres.","1972-04-29 14:39:28"
"326","28","448","1","Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmen√®re with a vital streak.","1996-10-24 03:38:00"
"246","62","768","1","A plump, juicy mouthful of citrusy fruit, worth trying with grilled or broiled seafood. The zesty lime aromas broaden out on the palate to include orange and tangerine flavors, making it tart but not too tart. Best Buy.","2015-01-11 04:39:32"
"1946","62","404","3","This medium-weight wine flows effortlessly from start to finish, blending aromas of smoke and nuts with a citrusy core. Picks up savory nutty, cheesy notes (like a good Gruy√®re) on the long finish.","1984-03-19 13:38:43"

"844","41","318","4","Crisp, green, grassy wine with fresh acidity and herbeceous character. It is very New World with its tropical flavors and open, forward fruit.","2000-09-06 07:09:22"
"1275","23","163","2","An irresistibly drinkable white wine, filled with the juiciest flavors of citrus fruits, fig, melon and peach, and just the tiniest bit sweet. Crisp acidity cleanses the palate and leaves it feeling minty fresh on the long, spicy finish.","2001-10-27 08:17:59"
"263","52","470","3","A soft, ripe wine that manages to showcase tobacco, earth and black cherry flavors in a relatively lightweight format, finishing long and tart.","1996-07-11 09:17:28"
"478","85","156","3","A well-judged, well-structured wine that balances fresh, crisp and light fruit against flavors of peaches, almonds and cinnamon. It will be better in two or three years' time.","2005-10-14 23:55:47"
"1953","86","752","0","A fresh, tangy, vibrant wine that has ripe green plum and apple flavors alongside a layer of full, forward fruit.","1991-01-03 17:06:04"
"1183","6","96","2","The color is appropriately light, the aromas appropriately floral and rose-like. Fleshy cherry flavors are balanced by a helping of greens and flowers. Light and elegant. Who would've thought Nebbiolo like this could come from Mexico?","1996-02-03 01:06:36"
"519","58","393","2","This blend of Chardonnay, Nosiola and Pinot Bianco offers up apples and cream on the nose, along with flavors of peach and citrus. It's a comfortable mix of fruit that finishes lively and fresh, making it a fine ap√©ritif.","1982-07-01 04:49:54"
"375","28","418","2","At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.","1978-03-10 09:29:45"
"1997","9","202","4","It's testament to this wine's balance that it remains so alive and fresh long after many other Biancos have faded. Intensely mineral aromas mix with notes of smoke and fresh apples; the flavors are earthy and hint at mineral oil. Long on the finish. Best Buy.","1974-08-07 06:52:58"
"667","27","923","1","With its herbal, traditional aromas, this New World Cabernet could impersonate and Old World model. The palate is tight and firm, with lively tannins and bracing acids.

"106","4","9","5","Aromas of roses, pepper and spices make this an enticing wine. On the palate, it is ripe, soft, full-bodied and rich, lacking acidity, but otherwise classic Gew√ºrztraminer.","2021-06-22 05:31:27"
"313","0","314","3","Richly textured, viscous but with good acidty for balance. The wine shows pretty melon, citrus, herb, grass, peach and spice flavors and features a mineral edge that is fresh and clean at the end.","1982-02-13 05:06:46"
"1438","32","380","5","A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging.","1971-03-16 13:32:44"
"1288","47","978","1","A great and versatile food wine. Its polished flavors of lime, fig and apricot are drizzled with Oriental spices and smoky oak. One of California's  most consistent wines, and rich enough to stand in for Chardonnay.","2014-11-22 08:13:49"
"878","5","805","4","Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.","1979-03-05 12:54:48"
"877","46","777","3","A blend of grapes, so maybe it is not surprising that the aromas and flavors are a blend: melons, pears and limes, all presented with great freshness and verve alongside a rich texture. Editors' Choice.","1991-03-13 17:36:47"
"1826","58","511","5","Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink, yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy.","2002-03-25 20:11:17"
"1712","17","930","0","With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit, this is no weakling. On the contrary, it's full and meaty, with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well.","1978-12-27 14:15:01"
"237","34","793","3","A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing.","1973-06-19 22:05:43"
"1190","23","921","3","Strongly oaked, but fresh, young and healthy in the nose. The smell of coconut and lemon curd is friendly and soft, while the palate is loaded with more lemon, coconut, pear and nutmeg. The texture is rich, and, for now, the acidity is bright. A solid Chardonnay for current drinking.","1989-08-26 18:12:42"
"1911","51","171","0","Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.","1973-09-17 08:08:57"
"979","83","74","5","This is the first vintage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc, named after the 16th-century abbess Rylint Formentini. Peppery in character, with rich, complex fruit, it has citric flavors, along with a sense of structure and acidity.","2005-07-24 10:47:33"
"455","19","95","0","Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own.","2017-05-22 16:10:45"
"1794","32","751","4","Fresh aromas of red cherry and light berry fruit precede a palate that runs a little racy, with borderline tart plum and pie cherry flavors. A solid mouthfeel and mild, chalky tannins give it presence, and for sure it's a clean, sturdy wine. But that's really as far as it goes.","1984-04-02 18:19:59"
"262","87","130","0","On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB. In the mouth, it's fairly lively and lifted, with nectarine and melon flavors that morph into pink grapefruit on the finish. Decent quality; will get the job done.","2015-09-15 22:53:04"
"1878","32","295","5","The wine starts off slowly due to a note of almond nut or cardboard that masks the natural fruit. Once it gets started, however, this luminous sparkling Prosecco offers cheerful notes of stone fruit and pear.","2016-03-20 11:47:04"
"1726","22","148","0","Tonic and lean with a nearly transparent color and lively perlage, this non-DOC Prosecco offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and lemon soda.

"100","44","242","2","This Extra Dry (slightly sweet) vintage Prosecco delivers a lean, slightly watery style and piquant bubbles that recall lemon soda. The wine is firm and steely in the mouth with tonic bubbling and layers of fresh fruit on the close.","1973-06-14 17:52:35"
"171","88","527","5","Formerly doing business as ‚ÄúShiraz,‚Äù this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint, roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire, and a ripe, grapey palate that brims with simple, racy black cherry, pepper and other driving flavors. Not timid by any means but also nothing out of the ordinary.","2000-08-02 19:43:55"
"867","46","304","2","Dry and acidic, this light-bodied wine has tart flavors of mashed cherries, cherryskins, orange zest and citrus fruits. It's a Bordeaux blend with Zinfandel and Sangiovese. Nice with pizza with prosciutto and olives.","1992-04-23 08:01:04"
"583","61","687","4","Smells funky, with sweaty leather aromas, although you'll also find varietal notes of the grape. Tastes all right, with blackberries, currants, leather and mocha that are wrapped into firm tannins.","1977-12-16 01:08:56"
"863","37","553","0","Citrus tones, peach, white flower and mineral notes come forward thanks to the wine's bright personality and zesty effervescence. There are soft notes of crushed pepper and loads of sweet stone fruit flavors to enjoy as well.","2005-04-23 06:13:12"
"874","78","555","0","A creamy, caramel- and pear-flavored wine, keeping freshness but enriched with an almond and custard tart finish.","1982-10-01 19:10:00"
"674","54","967","3","Aromas of baked apple, nut oil and toast are mildly appealing, while the round, dry palate is home to flavors of melon and bitter pith. The finish of peach pit and citrus peel is par for the course, and overall it's time to get at this standard Chardonnay before it goes flaccid.","1992-10-21 16:53:16"
"1510","99","808","0","This Prosecco delivers medium intensity and a compact, slightly watery mouthfeel followed by lime, kiwi, white flower, honey and chopped basil. The cheerful sparkler ends with creamy consistency thanks to the foamy quality of its effervescence.","1995-06-26 05:07:53"
"1501","44","267","5","Fresh and delicate with floral and citrus overtones, this wine has an elegant character. Its dry, spicy flavors are subtle and refreshing, giving the wine food pairing flexibility. Ideally, though, think of spicy cuisine like Indian, Thai or Indonesian.","2001-04-14 10:44:05"
"1034","99","966","0","An elegant nose of violet and blackberry gives this Cab Franc a graceful start. On the palate, soft cherry and blackberry flavors are punctuated by spice and pepper. An interesting sip that will pair well with fowl, beef.","2012-02-15 22:36:38"
"374","94","48","2","A nice Cabernet for this everyday price. Dry and smooth, it shows interesting flavors of black currants, plums, herbs and spice, with a touch of smoky oak.","1984-12-07 00:36:01"
"1291","81","147","1","Canah Brut Prosecco exhibits a slightly more saturated golden color and intense notes of mature peach, dried apricot with delicate mineral tones in the background. This rich sparkler is fatter and denser than most Proseccos and boasts an attractively low price tag.","1986-07-18 10:02:02"
"641","52","826","2","Here's an organically grown Prosecco with citrusy notes of lime and grapefruit backed by white mineral and orange blossom. The wine is firm and slightly sweet on the finish and offers an easy, no-fuss experience overall.","2002-07-15 23:12:52"
"1456","41","496","0","Here's a Prosecco with a broad and far-reaching aspect to its aromatic profile that recalls roasted almonds, mature peach and yellow rose. There's a pungent note in there as well of ash or talc powder and the sparkler ends with a playful blast of piquant spice.","2006-10-29 17:53:21"
"1297","72","278","5","Citrus and spice overtones dominate the nose of this elegant Riesling. On the palate, slightly sweet fruit flavors are balanced by mineral and spice. Pair with grilled seafood, salads and cheeses.","2019-07-12 20:55:23"

"867","18","629","3","Using many biodynamic practices, Werner Michlits has crafted a rich, sweet and juicy wine, full of intense fruit, touched by spice, but more to do with black plum, fresh figs and vivid acidity. This is a hearty wine, ready to drink, its final tannins soft. Screwcap.","1982-10-15 01:14:35"
"1047","3","700","5","A smooth, perfumed wine that has softened just in time for its fifth year. It has black-currant and berry fruits that are ripe while still showing fresh acidity. The tannic structure is there, well integrated into the polished structure. Drinkable now.","2021-06-28 05:39:11"
"1507","14","145","5","This is the first of 15 estates the Gonfrier family owns throughout Bordeaux. There are strong wood influences here, although the fruit is enough to match up. So ripe pear and apricot flavors go with those toasty characters to give a rich, full-bodied wine. It will be better from late 2016.","1994-02-03 00:12:00"
"988","13","128","5","All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee, Obelisco and Stonetree. The aromas are quite reserved, with notes of barrel spice that are followed by full-bodied fruit flavors with a spicy finish. It drinks well but the variety seems lost.","1979-04-22 03:37:33"
"1915","7","207","5","The light aromas suggest notes of star fruit and citrus. The palate is flavorful, with racy acids keeping the fruit in focus.","1997-07-24 19:58:47"
"1819","7","917","1","There is a savory, fragrant, mossy greenness that draws you in. On the concentrated palate, this becomes more distinct as the peel of Bosc pear and crushed arugula emerge. Lime zestiness comes with a slightly warm finish.","2020-02-09 20:11:43"
"756","29","890","1","This wine is dry and rather full bodied, starting with fruity aromas like banana and coconut then seguing to more nutty, oaky, complex flavors and a rich texture. It's a serious dinner wine with heft and substance.","2004-08-14 00:04:40"
"517","90","534","5","Blossom and berry notes are accented by hints of smoked nut in this refreshingly light-bodied wine. Zesty and lithe on the palate, it's an ideal summer-to-fall ap√©ritif or porch sipper. The moderately long finish is marked with a hint of waxy florals.","1986-10-16 21:32:06"
"227","57","762","4","Slightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy.","2004-12-13 05:06:07"

"1241","66","631","2","An earthy hint colors the pear notes which on the palate acquire a fresh, almost floral quality. The earthy tone of yeast and miso provides a counterpoint to the zesty, lime-peel freshness. The finish is clean-cut and very refreshing.","1984-04-01 02:25:28"
"162","0","86","0","Aromas of coffee, barrel spice and dark-blue fruit lead to rich, full-bodied blackberry and spice flavors. It's not for the faint of heart but delivers a lot of enjoyment.","1970-11-18 21:09:12"
"1919","15","685","5","Yellow pear, fresh-squeezed lime, light mint and wet-cement aromas show on the brisk nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach. A grippy texture and lively acidity frame the palate, where green apple and lime flavors show. It's clean, pure and easy.","1971-05-07 07:00:29"
"22","71","691","3","This Tempranillo-based pinkie is quite inviting and tightly textured, with aromas of orange shave ice, strawberry cream, watermelon and cement.

"197","90","139","0","The aromas of whole lime, flowers, jasmine and watermelon Jolly Rancher pop. It drinks off dry, with floral flavors that carry through the finish.","1979-08-18 20:17:34"
"1857","97","291","2","Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality.","2012-02-10 23:21:58"
"741","51","302","2","Coffee, toasted oak, coconut and raspberry confiture aromas lead the way. On the dense palate, dark chocolate, oak and licorice accent fleshy black cherry while fine-grained tannins provide support.","2020-12-07 07:16:21"
"22","88","396","4","Creamy notes pear crumble make for a most attractive nose. The palate follows with gentle softness and concentration, supported by bright, fresh acidity.

"1458","76","468","1","Aromas of apricot and white spring flower lift out of the glass. The apricot note follows through to the palate, along with yellow peach, honeydew melon and almond, all framed in bright acidity. This one closes on a flinty note.","2011-06-25 09:00:03"
"713","56","763","1","Blended from all five Bordeaux varieties, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot almost equal in proportion, this is a lovely, well-crafted wine, softly concentrated with highlights of licorice, lavender, violets and black pepper. From three ranches farmed by the family, it's both seamless and structured.","1983-03-27 04:48:10"
"921","31","514","1","Fresh, focused and tight on the nose, with an undertone of mild oak and earth, this gets going with ease. A fresh, fruity palate is just rugged enough, while flavors of black plum, cherry, licorice and herbs finish toasty, spicy and firm.","2006-03-15 04:43:41"

"1536","5","382","3","Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star.

"1228","72","931","0","Thickly moussed, Roederer's Brut, 60% Chardonnay blended with 40% Pinot Noir, aged two years on yeast is affordable and luxurious.

It's an ideal marriage of bright acidity and ripe fruit character.","2007-04-30 13:51:04"
"728","5","505","3","With a wine this finely constructed, the question is always ageability. There's no question about the immediate deliciousness. It's thrilling with raspberries, strawberries, orange rind and cola, and complex notes of minerals and earth. The mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful, comprised of silk and satin brightened with acidity. So should you drink it now? Yes. Will it age? For the next six years, yes.","2000-06-13 11:16:20"

"1637","97","519","0","Crisp and structured, this is an intensely mineral wine. It has great acidity and a strongly zesty, tangy character that still needs time to soften. It's bright, fruity and full of dancing freshness. It's good to go now, but keep until 2017 and it will be that much more complex.","1970-08-28 06:58:57"
"1349","90","0","4","Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble‚Äîone almost wants to say thistle‚Äîwrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.","2008-06-16 20:34:32"
"1905","14","272","2","The nose of this powerfully fruity yet dry Riesling packs a punch, with aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and floral potpourri. The palate is dense with stone fruit, and a hint of red berry flavor, but finishes elegantly with sleek mineral tones.","1981-05-17 17:27:53"

"152","53","939","1","This wine is ripe, rich and full in the mouth, like a fruit salad of red cherries, plums and berries.

"1402","94","480","4","A powerful wine, richly structured and full of ripe fruits. It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors.

"1891","68","206","5","Already mature, this is a rich and opulent wine that blends together toast and secondary-fruit aromas with fresh, lively acidity. It has weight and substantial depth and concentration. It should age well for another few years, but this impressive wine can be drunk now as well.","1989-05-22 08:58:32"
"966","8","183","3","This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging. The tannins remain robust, while the acidity is just about perfect for Napa Valley. Awkward now, but with a promising future, it should emerge from the doldrums after 2017.","2017-08-18 18:32:10"
"197","28","77","3","This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category. Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025.","1999-04-15 15:19:45"
"930","93","502","5","An interesting percentage of Cabernet Franc gives this wine a more perfumed character than is usual in many Pomerols. On the palate, the wine is rich and shows the aromatic character of the berry fruits and well integrated wood. It is young still, needing time. Drink from 2017.","1988-05-10 18:29:00"
"1256","80","587","0","This is a superior vintage Champagne that is just beginning to mature. Crisp white and citrus fruits are beginning to fade into mature toast and cookie flavors, but the wine maintains its zesty texture. Drink this wine now, but beware the cork is secured precariously with string that must be cut to open.","1994-09-01 22:35:08"
"567","82","864","4","Garnet-ruby in color, this has fresh aromas of white cherry, plum, dried dill and rosemary. The mouthfeel is simple and clean, with fresh acidity on the close.","1974-03-04 07:19:24"
"1013","43","941","2","This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. It remains a rather lean wine in the Sparkman portfolio, despite having alcohol at 14.6%.

"466","94","483","5","The alcohol is nice and low in this dry Pinot Noir. It has a silky texture and complex flavors of red cherries, persimmons, cola and spices. Acidity is great but there's something slightly off, suggesting a trace of unripeness. Drink now.","2019-05-01 23:19:00"

"1674","0","282","4","Bulky and rugged but sound, with some drying tannins on the finish. It compensates by offering attractive flavors of black cherries, black olives and hints of asphalt and garrigue. Try it with hearty braises or stews.","1972-03-19 11:32:38"
"1318","11","424","5","This smooth, lush Cabernet is brimming with blackberry, black currant, blueberry cedar and spice flavors. It's classic Cabernet. You'll find quite a scour of acidity running through the middle, which suggests this wine should pair with rich, fatty meats.","1992-12-03 03:08:32"
"484","55","7","0","A blend of Friulano and Verduzzo, this delivers aromas of candied fruit, yellow rose, butterscotch, spice and apricot. It opens a clear window onto the natural characteristics of both grape varieties.","1996-11-26 01:05:59"
"713","31","991","1","Pinot Grigio from the Friuli Grave tends to show extra creaminess and structure in the mouth. Here is a stellar example that's backed by flavors of peach, citrus and Golden Delicious apple.","2014-11-26 08:24:04"
"214","30","994","2","This bright white is redolent of tomato leaf, wild salvia and citrus. The brightness of the bouquet is followed by a satisfyingly creamy mouthfeel.","1999-11-21 03:52:14"
"1024","97","180","3","Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.","2006-10-08 00:08:35"
"1907","83","903","4","This is a soft, creamed-apple style of wine, with a great shaft of acidity cutting through the crisp fruit. Kiwi and gooseberry fruits are lifted on the bright, lively finish.","1976-06-22 03:55:45"
"1033","41","360","4","Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.","2001-03-10 09:00:14"
"1557","88","152","5","Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.","2002-04-29 01:30:18"
"282","44","982","2","This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.","1991-03-27 05:06:13"
"296","63","20","0","This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.","2006-03-29 12:18:45"
"1047","2","769","0","This barrel-fermented Verdejo is interesting, but it's also a bit low on acidity. It smells like pine and blowsy flowers.

"1592","15","649","4","This wine has the variety's trademark notes of herb, green bell pepper, with a woodsy qulaity. This is a full-bodied effort, bearing a long, spicy finish.","2011-12-20 15:30:01"
"710","41","119","0","There are lot's of cherry, cola, sandalwood and exotic spice flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with a nice crispness from the acidity.","1980-10-28 22:56:56"

"1155","88","442","1","Deliciously perfumed, this is as light as a feather, with baked apple and lemon flavors. It's crisp and honey sweet‚Äîa great ap√©ritif.","1972-07-19 22:03:16"
"1557","88","381","2","Sauvignon Blanc has been a consistent performer for Hanna, usually yielding a rich, ripe wine with brisk acidity. The '11 is one of their best efforts. It's tart, clean and savory, with the pineapple, tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors touched with a slight sweetness.","1991-10-15 14:46:51"
"1729","66","659","4","A simple but attractive C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne, with impressively pure cherry-berry fruit, medium body and a slightly chunky feel. Drink it over the next couple of years.","1973-01-11 18:00:30"
"1206","75","189","0","Full and smoky, with bacon, blackberry and tire rubber on the nose. This is a bit grating in feel due to full tannins and acids, with wild berry flavors, bitter oak, black plum and darkness. Lengthy on the finish.","1971-06-01 04:32:07"
"1716","5","14","4","A blend of 70% Pinot Grigio and 30% Ribolla Gialla, this bright white opens with floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle, white pepper and stone fruit. The Ribolla Gialla element adds structure and notes of caramel and pineapple.","1994-07-07 18:48:22"
"47","77","784","2","Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.","1973-08-28 22:22:24"
"1724","36","146","1","This is a mix of fruit from both warm and cool vineyards, crafting a clean, fresh, lightly herbal wine with a pleasing dusty character. Hints of cocoa and toast annotate the tart berry fruit, with a thread of smoke and chalk running through the tannins.","1989-07-02 12:57:31"
"1844","35","598","5","This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.","2018-05-23 19:04:17"
"326","28","688","3","Flint and smoke aromas show strongly on this bottling, alongside hints of lemon balm and a rustic apple cider vinegar savory kick. Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang.","2015-03-24 05:18:01"
"1768","91","69","1","This potentially rich Champagne is still young. The Chardonnay and Pinot Noir that dominate the blend show tight acidity, minerality and a tangy, orange-like edge. Give it time to mature, and it will be splendid.","2018-01-24 05:13:42"
"713","31","122","5","Aged for an extra two years to soften its tense acidity, this Champagne is defiantly bone-dry yet not searing. Its ripe and rich fruitiness cushions the crisp acidity and taut, nervy citrus character. Drink now.","2004-03-07 05:27:23"
"635","29","938","3","Big tannins support the layers of extracted, concentrated fruit that leans red into cherry, cassis and currant. Char and vanilla speak for the oak.","2016-06-15 11:48:51"
"1537","2","38","2","Baked blueberry and boysenberry aromas are more ripe than delicate. This Merlot is saturated and deeply tannic. Flavors of coffee, chocolate and lemon peel precede a toasty finish that overflows with chocolaty oak and lingering tannins. Drink through 2023.","1983-06-20 00:37:30"
"1367","71","654","5","Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure. A pleasing streak of cardamom is consistent throughout, as accents of forest floor and cola figure in.","1991-09-29 19:25:27"
"568","84","551","1","This is a relatively thick and dense wine, grippy in tannin and oak at first, youthful and desiring of time and air. Beyond its strength, its shows the beginnings of delicacy and grace, commingling raspberry with clove and tea.","2003-01-22 06:36:38"

"1405","13","594","0","From a walled vineyard once owned by the local bishop, this wine is structured and firm while also having great red cherry and berry fruit. It's one of a number of Premier Crus from this producer‚Äîand certainly the most expressive with its generous fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2018.","2001-12-28 03:55:39"
"1484","47","120","4","Deliciously fruity but also well-structured, this full-bodied wine has excellent concentration and good balance.

"1139","57","823","1","Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.","1987-04-17 13:49:01"
"1371","70","293","2","This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food.","2001-03-01 06:42:42"
"1869","44","354","5","The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.","2010-07-21 14:42:28"
"1349","39","904","2","There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.","1993-10-17 08:28:18"
"673","44","637","4","Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor.","1998-05-28 16:09:18"

"832","73","865","4","Just 8% of this reserve spent time in new oak, putting the emphasis on juicy jammy flavors of cranberry fruit. It rolls into sour cherry, some citrus and a most refreshing, clean and vivid mouthfeel. Drink now and into the mid-2020s.","2014-02-19 05:12:13"
"852","23","985","4","A surprising whiff of black currant on the nose of this elegant white points to Scheurebe‚Äîone of Germany's lesser-known grapes. Wittmann's version is particularly poised, offering loads of peach and grapefruit flavors, sharply contrasted by zesty lime and mineral tones. The finish is long and sleek, touched by a hint of bee pollen.","1992-09-26 05:07:02"
"837","77","552","3","This producer shows its preference for dry Champagnes with this bone-dry, oak-fermented bottling.

"1581","99","932","4","One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.","2013-02-20 01:45:59"
"676","14","151","4","Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through.

This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.","1974-02-16 02:27:51"
"206","81","137","1","Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch.

"561","9","70","5","From the gorgeous, mighty Pagani, planted in 1895, comes this powerfully rich and refined wine, a study in woodsy rusticity and layers of fig, blackberry and a stick of cinnamon. Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020.","1983-04-03 09:43:51"

"1747","24","942","2","As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare.

"1144","77","698","4","Fruity and ripe, the wine also has some solid structure to give it a core of dark tannins. The black-currant fruits are developing well, bringing their crispness to the party. Drink this wine from 2018.","2005-08-24 04:29:21"
"642","40","661","3","This bend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache is nevertheless very pale in hue. the nose hints at wet stone, thyme and bay leaf, while the medium-bodied palate delivers a harmonious blend of red berries and citrus. Long on the finish, with mouthwatering persistence.","1985-07-17 01:25:50"
"521","69","727","4","This is a juicy wine with its red fruits and attractive acidity. The wood aging still shows, perhaps too strongly, but that fruit is already a major factor in the success of the wine. Drink from 2019.","1971-10-16 19:24:41"
"945","6","965","5","From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine.

"810","27","406","3","Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc hangs together easily on this herb-dominant wine. The texture has a creamy character, showing green fruits, lively acidity and a bright orange-zest aftertaste.","1991-06-13 07:52:23"
"918","10","590","3","Gr√ºner Veltliner, though still rare, shows good promise in Oregon. This is a big, sappy, ripe version that's borderline syrupy, with big flavors of peaches and apricots. But the supporting acids, and a lick of mineral, keep it from crashing.","1986-10-11 05:20:57"
"808","97","642","4","A touch of oak adds a sweet, smoky creaminess to this wine, but it's really dominated by Sauvignon Blanc's acidity and racy spearmint and tropical fruit. The alcohol is moderate, making it easy to drink.","2001-09-06 04:55:29"
"1884","1","588","3","This is a good Pinot Noir that's full-bodied, dry and silky in the mouth, with crisp acidity. It shows raspberry, cola and green tea flavors. Hard to predict if it has a future, so drink now‚Äì2014.","1994-08-12 11:44:31"

"1785","10","440","3","The dynamic sisters that run this estate deliver a clean and territory-driven line of white wines. This easy Soave Classico opens with peach, pear, citrus and a touch of fragrant honeysuckle flower. It's pure and focused overall.","1971-04-14 09:17:04"
"1771","14","245","4","Four years running this wine has scored 87 and been a Best Buy. The bouquet is scratchy but nicely aromatic, including hints of spice to go with ripe berry scents. The palate is jammy and home to rooty berry, mild spice and very light oak flavors. The finish is a bit hot and fiery, which food will tame.","2000-01-10 13:35:09"
"1391","92","715","5","This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.","2018-08-19 04:37:27"
"1323","77","222","1","This bubbly Prosecco Superiore offers vibrant tones of white flower and cut grass followed by light touches of peach and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft with a subtle touch of sweetness.","1998-11-22 06:44:42"
"332","47","165","4","Softly delicious, this is a beautiful Merlot to drink now. It's a little hot in alcohol on the finish, but feels elegant in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, currants and mocha.","2018-07-08 09:45:48"
"844","71","494","3","Here's a Chardonnay-based sparkler from Piedmont that opens with bright tones of lemon and sweet grapefruit followed by yeasty tones of freshly baked bread. There's some bitter almond as well, which adds tartness to the finish.","1976-09-23 06:13:58"
"866","37","610","1","Extra sweetness and density give this wine a full and generous personality. Dry Proseccos usually show a little extra peach juice and nectarine, as this wine does, without being heavy or cloying.","1971-11-01 11:12:18"
"1254","9","434","0","An easy Pinot Noir, but by no means lacking elegance. It shows the moderate body and crisp, citrusy acidity that usually marks Edna Valley Pinot Noir, with pure, direct flavors of sour-cherry candy, cola, cinnamon and toast.","1986-06-25 01:11:49"
"1374","52","848","4","Mostly Syrah, with just a dash of Petite Sirah (2%) and Petit Verdot (1%), this red from Sawtooth and Skyline vineyards brings light notes of smoked meat, chocolate, and flowers. The enjoyment here is mainly focused on mouthfeel, which is voluptuous and rich, leading to an open finish.","2011-05-31 18:44:38"
"852","23","522","4","This unusual blend of 85% Syrah, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Petite Sirah comes together nicely, with the Syrah lending notes of cranberry and smoked meat and the Petit(e)s adding some heft to the plush texture and bitterness on the finish.","1978-11-09 06:16:39"
"1486","13","484","5","Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix. The aromas are light, with notes of berry and sweet spices. The cherry flavors are very soft, getting a bit attenuated on the back half on this otherwise pleasant red.","1992-12-05 06:27:36"
"1909","63","589","3","Here's a pure expression of the Garganega grape that sees (in part) 8 months of oak aging for extra density and thickness. The wine shows spicy notes of cinnamon and white pepper backed by peach and candied fruit.","2013-02-26 17:18:11"
"1738","64","592","2","Made with the indigenous Garganega grape (the same variety that makes Soave), this richly extracted white wine opens with an off-gold color and ripe notes of apricot and peach nectar.","2006-03-05 12:52:14"
"1771","14","493","1","This pretty white wine from northern Italy opens with an ashy, mineral feel and segues to aromas of candied fruit, peach and citrus. It is nearing the end of its drinking window so don't bother putting this bottle aside.","1980-11-14 01:11:50"
"866","18","36","4","This plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef. Tannins are supple enough to make this wine drinkable now, yet plentiful enough to suggest ample cellaring potential. Drink now-2030.","1976-12-22 23:16:19"
"388","47","28","1","Each year, this wine is intended to be an experiment. This vintage's creativity involves the addition of soil from the Santa Rita Hills to vineyards in the Russian River Valley. Yeasty on the nose, the result is rich and decadent, a wine that's juicy and velvety in black and red fruit and pillowy tannins. A warmth of spice lingers on the finish.","1992-02-06 18:22:10"
"1553","89","481","1","From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025.","2000-03-05 21:47:52"
"1594","78","255","1","Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness. This strikes an appetizing, moreish palate and makes for joyful drinking.","1979-01-27 14:48:58"
"1758","39","678","2","Ripe fragrant, yellow mirabelle plums constitute the chief perfume of this charming wine. The palate holds even more fruity nuance but is dry, concentrated and linear, being carried forward by zesty freshness and lemony overtones. This is clean, charming, taut and dry with a bracing nature and a clean, brisk finish.","1988-10-02 07:24:46"
"891","70","286","2","This full-bodied wine is rich without ever seeming overdone. Subtle smoke notes frame bold fruit‚Äîtangerine, pineapple and apricot‚Äîand gingery spice, while the finish is long, peppery and refreshing. Drink now‚Äì2020.","1986-06-20 19:41:27"
"1840","82","785","0","From a two-acre block within the amazing Maple Vineyard planted in 1910, this wine also contains 10% Petite Sirah and 10% mixed blacks. Baked berry pie comes to mind first, conjuring up all things good and right in the world, topped in bourbon whipped cream and nutmeg. Good acidity buoys the proceedings. Drink now through 2021.","2016-05-03 18:02:05"
"1415","35","160","2","Aromas of wood grain, vanilla, butter and fino Sherry are elegant and attractive for this style of white Rioja. On the palate, this oak-aged Viura is smooth, while creamy flavors of oak, apricot and peach excel. A smooth finish with plenty of vanilla and core acidity indicates this will age well for another 10 years.","2014-05-03 11:20:16"
"800","81","668","1","The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now‚Äì2025.","1995-06-17 09:26:58"
"1962","75","275","2","A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.","2011-03-26 12:05:18"
"13","10","23","0","A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016‚Äì2020.","1987-03-22 19:11:54"
"1593","20","190","5","There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane.","1982-09-29 19:27:09"
"1679","35","332","3","Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy.","1983-01-18 06:56:41"
"52","86","740","1","Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper.","1974-09-18 23:55:26"
"1277","23","580","5","This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured. Wood aging has added a layer of complexity and broadened out the fruits and dark tannins. Drink from 2017.","2013-03-12 11:37:59"
"856","70","755","2","Creamy in texture and floral in aroma, this is a lovely and well-integrated white wine, with well-crafted characteristics of pear and honeyed apple. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table and on its own.","2010-07-03 08:40:30"
"1017","81","400","0","Boosted by 5% Petit Verdot, this bottling shows lush aromas of fudge, black plum, black currant, soy and black pepper.

"825","32","937","3","Pommard and W√§denswil clones are combined here, yielding a stylish, well-defined wine with spicy berry fruit. Flavors punch through into a deep and detailed finish, with streaks of cola and caramel. The balance is spot-on.","2002-09-20 05:20:49"
"845","5","607","2","As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.","1984-06-17 20:05:52"
"1155","93","410","3","This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by Jo√£o Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.","2020-03-02 03:31:14"
"1991","65","240","4","A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic sp√§tlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note.","1982-06-02 14:59:13"
"829","85","32","4","With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.","1988-01-12 13:10:56"
"668","80","916","0","You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white.

It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage.","1975-01-24 23:49:46"
"1679","45","465","0","Subtle notes of clean, fresh lemon zest promise pleasure, the palate reveals a far riper aspect of fresh red apple and baked apples. The dry palate remains zingy and clean and provides ample textured freshness. The effect is that of fresh apple sorbet.","1980-05-30 15:34:08"
"896","31","462","5","Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.","1976-11-02 08:49:47"
"1536","74","871","4","Reserved red-cherry fruit aromas gain complexity with fog-soaked sagebrush, dried purple flowers and an earthy mushroom character on the nose. Roasted shiitake, marjoram, crushed Brazil nuts and a hint of cardamom play on the dark, spicy, earthy palate, laid across a bed of cranberry fruit.","1999-12-19 19:42:03"
"676","20","846","3","Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure.","1982-11-24 10:41:19"
"1997","41","692","3","This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.","1978-11-22 10:01:51"
"1558","60","284","1","This cuv√©e is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020‚Äì2030.","2013-10-03 16:40:22"
"100","40","261","5","The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.","1997-03-02 15:49:43"
"259","27","599","1","This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh.","1997-03-04 01:48:05"
"78","69","521","4","This wine brings aromas of blackberry, dates and spice. The palate displays abundant cherry flavors with lightly chalky tannins.","2003-09-28 23:52:20"
"1107","90","90","1","Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020.","2010-06-03 18:55:17"
"1831","17","498","4","Livelier than usual in texture and popping with bright citrus aromas and flavors, this light-bodied and barrel-fermented wine is a great palate-cleanser and will pair beautifully with dishes like raw oysters and herbed goat cheese. It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance.","1994-04-02 21:10:13"
"1299","68","501","4","Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo.

"1155","88","818","1","Ripe black cherry and vanilla swirl around notes of cedar and dusty tannins, combining seamlessly on the palate. From an appellation not known for the variety, it does justice to mountain fruit and power, finishing with substance.","2009-07-14 09:09:58"

"1902","91","258","0","This warm-vintage wine is more aromatically reticent than recent vintages, with notes of stone fruit, slate and mineral. It drinks a hair off dry, with depth to the lightly spritzy fruit flavors and razor-sharp acidity.","1985-06-22 12:57:25"
"947","97","724","0","Perfumed plum and raspberry aromas are slightly earthy and leathery. This is medium-to-full in body, with smooth, chunky tannins. Earthy, lightly baked plum and wild-berry flavors finish loamy and expansive. Drink through 2017.","2021-07-31 11:08:50"
"1657","22","660","0","While dry in style, this lithe, delicately framed Riesling packs a punch of ripe, rich tropical fruit. It's blossomy and buoyantly fruity, yet brashly mineral as well.

"1570","7","783","2","The winery's larger bottling of the variety, one it has mastered for decades, this wine is a mix of baked plum and rustic leather notes. It's softly tannic, with pronounced jolts of tobacco and black pepper.

"272","48","644","5","This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018.","1981-11-18 06:46:47"
"1368","59","712","5","Made with Sangiovese blended with 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante Bouschet, this savory wine opens with aromas of underbrush, ripe berry, tobacco leaf and Mediterranean herb. The vibrant, refined palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, orange peel, licorice and white pepper alongside supple tannins. It closes on a mineral note. Enjoy through 2020.","1986-04-14 05:15:54"
"1946","62","266","3","Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017.","2005-03-31 12:06:36"
"1382","77","124","4","This is a well-balanced, well-structured white wine that's sure to evolve through 2020, at least. It's certainly attractive now, with subtle toasty notes of sweet spice and wood-grilled apple alongside hints of kiwi, sweet grass, green plum and lime. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidity and a streak of minerality that keeps things fresh and lifted through the softly spiced finish.","1989-10-17 04:43:07"
"1579","30","417","4","Aromas of violet, iris, forest floor, woodland berry and allspice lead the nose on this structured, savory wine. The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry, mocha, clove, tobacco and licorice alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's firm and well balanced.","2008-03-05 22:50:04"
"899","20","320","3","The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus‚Äîthink white grapefruit‚Äîand melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package.","1994-12-27 08:55:22"
"1732","31","997","3","Lively notes of fresh yellow plum and mandarin open up into a friendly, fresh palate that combines rich fruit and zingy citrus to great effect. The result is lip-smacking freshness with lots of midpalate concentration and zing.","1986-10-07 07:21:38"
"704","16","310","0","Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price.","2014-11-01 06:04:35"
"976","85","958","0","This classic, iconic Pinotage opens with dense aromas of pressed purple violets, forest berries, raspberry sauce and fudge brownie. The lush and decadent palate offers more of the same, with a crushed velvet texture and final notes of licorice and toasted spice that linger long. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2022.","2002-11-18 02:08:14"
"683","7","157","4","Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now.","2002-09-26 17:53:44"
"462","34","435","4","Always released after a further year's aging, this rich and full-bodied wine is now at its peak. With a dense texture, layers of spice and vanilla as well as intense red fruits, this powerful wine expresses the more complex side of Provence ros√©. Drink now.","2019-05-25 08:46:48"
"1063","1","756","0","Produced by the owners of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape estate Ch√¢teau Mont-Redon, this is a full and fruity wine. It has a good balance between acidity and red berry fruits that give a rich character. Packed with flavor, it's ready to drink.","2007-09-21 08:59:51"
"1911","23","771","3","While the wine is really pale in color, it does have a great range of flavors, offering red fruit notes balanced by beautiful acidity and citrus streaks. It's gently textured, giving a good bite to the fruitiness at the end.","1973-11-02 19:33:37"
"1206","3","730","2","This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015.","1973-01-09 12:26:33"
"1421","3","695","2","Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish.","1980-11-01 14:58:46"
"121","76","898","2","Very fruity and fresh, this wine has crisp apples as well as red fruit giving it a bright, delicious feeling. The acidity goes right through the wine, giving a beautifully fresh feel that points up the fragrant raspberries. Vineyards are in the heart of the sandy soils of the Saint Tropez peninsula.","1982-09-22 06:06:10"
"782","46","975","3","Rounded and soft, this rich ros√© is fruity while also perfumed. The blending of Syrah in the mix gives the wine a sense of power and concentration, making it an adquate partner at the dinner table.","2004-05-01 05:28:26"
"408","62","922","1","This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015.","1976-05-29 14:43:21"
"913","59","166","2","Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020.","1989-10-23 05:30:34"
"1540","92","162","0","As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019.","1989-11-09 03:57:36"
"1663","87","178","2","Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like. Stainless-steel fermentation gives it a lean underbelly, rounded out by sharp Meyer lemon and tangerine, buoyed by mouthwatering acidity. Green apple and an accent of honey peak on the finish.","2015-12-02 11:36:13"
"921","51","29","3","Light in color and weight, this vineyard-designate conveys a wealth of rose petals, earth and bright, crisp red cherry. Compellingly layered and shy, it defines the term ethereal. The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom.","2008-12-20 14:43:41"
"1378","64","83","5","This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first. Decanting or letting the wine open in the glass will help, but still it retains smooth, velvety tannins and resolved oak.","2007-11-29 03:10:49"
"383","48","121","4","Alluring notes of Asian five spice and wet stone frame ripe cherry aromas in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is firm, becoming faintly dusty on the finish, but the wine is approachable now for its cherry fruit and appealing damp clay quality. Drink now‚Äì2018.","1985-06-12 06:13:01"
"1799","34","537","4","Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced. Ripe, enticing flavors of wild berry and cassis are backed by toast, chocolate, vanilla and coconut notes as well as heat and burn. Drink through 2019.","1994-05-30 13:48:08"
"1695","70","999","1","Even Carrick's entry-level wine has turned out well in 2013, offering a sturdy, robust mouthful of dark fruit. Plum, espresso and dark chocolate mingle on the nose and palate, while the finish is long, faintly dusty and mouthwatering. Drink 2017‚Äì2025.","1992-04-16 08:00:15"
"690","61","55","3","An addition to the worldwide JCB brand, produced by the Boisset family of Burgundy, this feels rich and sumptuous, full of ripe red fruits and juicy plums. It is also balanced and well structured. Drink this wine with food.","1990-06-25 23:43:40"
"1235","8","236","1","Heading nicely in the crisp and aromatic direction, this is a light and bright wine. It has a citrus flavor that is balanced by richer pear and plum fruits. The wine is ready to drink.","2019-01-30 19:28:11"
"1284","46","123","1","This soft wine has a gentle texture and smooth white fruits. It is fruity and lightly perfumed. With its crisp edge of acidity, is totally ready to drink.","1987-04-14 19:00:03"

"531","44","952","5","Saucy berry and tea aromas are herbal, earthy and stewed. This feels full but syrupy. Flavors of cooked berry, molasses and mocha finish sweet and soupy, with only a touch of acidic offset.","1971-06-20 16:46:19"
"639","44","944","1","Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit.","1982-04-25 01:19:41"
"811","52","132","4","In a medium sweet style, the wine has a light prickle and fine citrus acidity to balance the soft freshness. It is a refreshing wine, totally drinkable immediately.","1970-11-27 14:00:55"
"1019","26","817","1","Peach, banana peel and a slight petrol note show mildly on the nose. The round palate boasts tart peach, pineapple rind and bitter lemon zest.","2002-07-27 14:20:55"
"1366","14","851","1","This has aromas that recall leafy underbrush, sawdust and menthol. The dense, oak-driven palate shows licorice, espresso, toast and a hint of bitter chocolate but the fruit has dried up. It abruptly ends on a green note of powdered sage.","1980-04-08 10:49:19"
"43","11","134","5","A rose pink colored wine that is dry and with ripe fruit. Its acidity contrasts with the warm red-berry fruit and the edge of tannin. There is a peppery, crisp aftertaste.","1992-12-05 21:47:07"
"1464","14","652","0","Light strawberry fruit carries an undertone of dried grass. It turns a little sour in the mouth, but it's fine for the price.","1993-03-31 05:18:48"
"1464","27","983","3","Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose. A mid-level palate holds nectarine, lychee and oily flavors that turn bitter on the finish.","1977-07-06 18:05:54"
"1324","87","541","1","The wine is ripe with apple and creamed pear flavors. It is warm, rich and missing acidity. There is an attractive almond and spice character to this ripe wine. Drink now.","1994-10-07 03:50:24"
"168","12","467","5","This wine looks, smells and tastes on the light side. Herb and red-cherry aromas precede rather lean flavors from cherry to clove and dill, and a brisk texture with some tannic grip.","2020-12-02 00:25:50"
"1258","88","680","1","Here is a simple but tasty Chard, offering attractive notes of pear, spiced orange and toasted apple skin on the nose and mouth. It's light weight and well balanced, with ample acidity and a short but clean finish. Enjoy now.","2012-01-26 01:42:41"
"1840","82","450","2","This is a soft and jammy wine with attractive ripe strawberry fruit and only the lightest structure. It is gentle, rounded and ready to drink.","2012-08-16 23:40:05"
"302","73","775","5","This wine is extracted and tough. The acidity does come through to help out, although it still has a hard edge with some bitter toast. It will soften, leaving some perfumed fruit for the future.","1970-07-09 17:31:28"
"302","73","653","4","Raisiny and earthy on the nose, this Bonarda also offers damp aromas of fern and tobacco. Chunky, with a soft, flat palate, this tastes raisiny and stewed. Low acidity and raisiny flavors on the finish are consistent with what came before.","2001-03-28 06:20:46"
"676","14","347","0","Oily, gritty aromas of almond skins set up a pungent but oily tasting palate. Core fruit flavors lean towards sour grapefruit and orange, while the finish is tangy, salty and sour through the last note.","1976-12-03 15:39:49"
"679","30","17","5","A rare miss for this winery, this bottling shows cooked red cherries, dust, vanilla and caramel on the somewhat hollow nose. The palate is almost overly rich with caramelized black cherry, fudge and chalky tannins. Patience will likely improve this one.","2017-01-15 19:41:48"
"748","92","243","5","This raspberry-flavored wine is soft and ripe. While it is fruity, it also has a nutty character that gives it a rich taste. It's dry and in a style that will make it better with food than by itself.","1984-01-02 12:01:55"
"410","8","542","2","Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors.","1976-09-16 04:29:07"
"1168","27","87","5","Roasted coffee bean and menthol aromas lead the nose while the evolved palate offers dark bitter chocolate, licorice and a toasted note. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit has largely dried up while astringent tannins lead to a bracing finish.","1991-02-11 01:31:28"
"1131","64","488","5","There seems to be a dusty veil over the fruit of this sold, approachable Sangiovese. A bit of sweet spice creeps up on the palate, making it enjoyable by itself or paired alongside pizza Tuesday.","2002-06-25 03:23:06"
"1275","1","662","3","This light and fruity wine offers soft tannins and an earthy character. The wine comes mainly from Beaujolais with 15% of Pinot Noir from the M√¢con region. Drink now.","2003-12-19 21:31:07"
"1588","8","605","0","This wine has acidity and a good balance between the fresh, crisp character and the richer yellow fruits. It is ready to drink.","1999-04-23 06:02:25"
"47","62","532","3","Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine. That sensation may stem from the pushing-the-envelope generosity of the ripe fruit or from the oak. or both. It makes for a full-bodied, heady experience.","2013-02-28 04:23:24"
"20","2","760","4","This opens with unusual aromas that recall minestrone soup, celery and glazed onion that carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness and is rather muddled, offering flavors reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce. Tasted both bottles, same notes.","2009-11-27 07:00:27"
"246","45","834","1","The grape is local to the Vidigueira region of the southern Alentejo. Coming from cool vineyards, the wine has a fresh character that is balanced by the ripe melon and juicy pear fruits. It has a crisper end and is ready to drink.","1973-10-04 15:09:44"
"1362","85","140","5","Melon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish.","1978-10-10 22:01:52"
"1119","4","447","3","A nice Pinot Noir, dry and elegant, and if it's somewhat one-dimensional, it packs a lot of flavor. With rich raspberry, red licorice, bacon and spice flavors, it's a lovely wine to drink now.","2021-08-04 21:21:16"
"1096","45","912","3","The sweet scent of raspberry and strawberry preserves waft from this Cab Franc icewine from Casa Larga. On the palate as well, there's a nice concentration of preserved berry flavors that soar on the palate with a bright, sunny acidity. Finishes clean and long with just a hint of autumn leaves and bramble.","2003-09-22 08:56:05"
"941","86","718","5","A soft style of Riesling, with some attractive aromatic white flower character. The fruit is soft, just off dry, freshened by acidity. Screwcap.","1971-07-17 11:14:13"
"131","83","428","0","Soft and appealing, this Pinot offers lush, elaborate flavors of raspberry and cherry pie filling, mocha and sandalwood flavors, finished with sweet, dusty Indian spices. It's made for drinking now.","1980-07-29 19:34:37"
"1184","96","489","5","A little hard at first, with match stick aromas. After that blows off, there's green fruit notes carrying the nose. Full in the mouth, with acidic cut and spunky flavors of nectarine and orange. Finishes round, with citrus and passion fruit.","2004-07-26 11:22:27"
"1442","26","840","5","Blowsy, lychee aromas, a wine that is ripe, soft, open, with a light touch of acidity. Pepper and sweet spices fit well into this easy profile. Screwcap.","1972-09-03 09:05:31"
"1260","71","26","4","With brisk Edna Valley acidity and intensely pure Chardonnay fruit flavors of tangerines, limes and sweet Meyer lemon sour candy, this is a pleasant sipper with roasted or grilled salmon, or a barbecue chicken or pork skewer with pineapples, green peppers and onions.","2011-04-11 07:06:55"
"1281","96","249","4","Pulpy and also minerally on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas. Zesty, crisp and defined by slate and lime in the mouth, with apple, lime and dryness to the flavor profile. A composed little white wine for simple sipping or white sangria.","2012-11-17 05:47:50"
"439","89","622","4","Shows the perfect balance and varietal richness that Anderson Valley Gew√ºrztraminers are known for. With crisp acidity, it has exotic flavors of Asian pears, candied pears, tangerines, gingersnap cookies and dusty spices, with a dry finish. Would score much higher if it were more concentrated.","2005-09-06 03:16:51"
"1022","11","530","0","A good, rich, flashy Zinfandel. There's not much to get excited about, but it delivers Zin's personality in a most attractive way. It's spicy, rich and sweet in cherry, raspberry, cocoa, honey and spice flavors.","2019-06-14 09:08:32"
"357","42","490","3","Funky, with mushroom and sweaty leather aromas that can best be described as Burgundian. But it's richly sweet in raspberries and cherries, and the smoky oak is nicely integrated with the fruit. A pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now.","1996-08-27 05:35:41"
"1043","11","884","0","This is a dry, elegant young Pinot Noir. It's rich in acidity, and the cherry and cola flavors are sprinkled with zesty white pepper. Seems to be giving its best now.","1997-04-25 13:05:27"
"1442","10","257","5","A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.","1999-12-06 17:06:35"
"1341","39","226","5","The blackberry, blueberry, bacon, pepper and sandalwood flavors are nice, and the wine finishes dry. A good, rich Syrah for drinking now if you're looking for a full-bodied and tannic red wine. Give it a brief decant.","1975-09-01 07:13:36"
"247","75","915","4","Cola, root beer and other earthy aromas open up this full-bodied blend of 70% Cabernet and 30% Carmen√®re. The palate shows pointed, prickly acidity and flavors of black cherry and cassis. Offers a rich flavor profile but the acidity creates bite and sharpness.","2019-08-27 08:09:10"
"1113","29","807","4","Round and good by Rueda standards, with melon and peach aromas but not too much citrus. The palate is full and chunky, with papaya, melon and a touch of pithy bitterness. More regular than special, but good and goes down easy before finishing dry.","2015-03-31 11:42:34"
"300","14","172","1","White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.","2001-02-24 06:45:36"
"1085","77","523","5","A touch overripe, showing some bitter, dried raisinskin notes. If you can get past that, you'll find plenty of rich blackberry, dark chocolate, plum, beef jerky and black pepper flavors.","2004-01-30 00:35:43"
"338","13","300","0","Ripe enough in blackberries, currants and mocha, with an earthy, tobacco herbaceousness. The tannins are potent, making the wine hard. Drink now, after a good decanting.","2007-04-23 00:52:05"
"852","60","438","0","Light, fresh and silky‚Äîjust what might be expected from cool-climate Pinot Noir. A pleasant earthiness underscores prettily interwoven strands of herbs and cherries. It's exciting to see the burgeoning quality of the wines coming out of Tasmania.","1996-01-20 03:54:11"
"1401","2","574","2","Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean. The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for.","1973-07-04 23:38:45"
"917","78","57","5","A good value in easy-to-drink Cabernet, McWilliam's 2008 is plummy and chocolaty, with soft tannins and a velvety finish. A bit simple perhaps, but definitely satisfying. Drink now.","1971-03-07 16:47:41"
"574","67","564","2","Here's a jammy, overtly ripe expression of Aglianico that ultimately proves to be an easier and more immediate expression of this naturally tannic grape variety. Aromas include candied fruit, blackberry preserves, raw cherry and raisin.","1981-01-29 00:30:48"
"941","68","105","4","Now with its intensity and some bottle age, this wine‚Äîformerly known as Cr√©mant de Cramant‚Äîis rich, with its apple flavor blending with an almond note and a soft, warm texture. The acidity shoots right through this ripe wine.","2021-09-19 05:01:11"
"816","85","192","4","A beautiful sparkling wine that shows the Iron Horse signature of balanced elegance. The lime, raspberry, vanilla and brioche flavors are rich and intricate, but particularly lovely is the texture, which is soft and silky.","1985-12-25 03:22:59"
"1598","95","960","0","Fight your way through the string and wax sealing that holds down the cork, and you'll discover a wine that is rich, full and opulent. The ripe peach character is balanced with the delicious toasty edge and final bright acidity. Ready to drink.","2018-04-02 22:12:11"
"30","40","540","5","Powerful and concentrated, this is just at its peak. Ripe, rich fruit and tarry tannins give it freshness and a dry core. It's solid and serious, a dense wine that calls for equally rich food. Drink it now while it's at its prime.","1984-04-27 16:52:49"
"724","18","109","2","The Lorna Marie is the winery's reserve, and it has exceptional concentration and depth. Berry and cherry dominate, spiced up with a pumpkin pie accent. Round, rich and full, yet moderate in alcohol, this is a fine expression of Oregon Pinot Noir in a challenging vintage.","1987-11-04 05:48:16"
"659","97","776","0","All the 2010 Patton Valley Pinots are significantly lower in alcohol than the previous vintage, and it works to their advantage. Nuanced fruit flavors include rhubarb and tart cherry, with veins of cola and dark chocolate adding further complexity. Its length is excellent.","1997-05-21 23:29:34"
"436","82","24","2","The extra age on this bone-dry wine has paid off, as the taut character of a young wine has been tempered with toast, creating a round feeling. It is perfectly in harmony now, beautiful and crisp.","1983-02-05 03:07:41"
"1691","50","383","0","Verduzzo is a very interesting grape that tends to exude oxidized aromas of candied fruit, butterscotch and carmel. But when made well, as in the case of this selection, it offers power, concentration and natural richness as well.","1985-12-16 22:07:32"
"348","71","464","4","The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots. Its distinctive minerality accompanies tart cranberry and cherry notes, citrusy acidity with a splash of grapefruit flavor, and a finish that tastes of coffee and tea. Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.","1985-06-03 10:16:03"
"1421","61","72","5","This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011.","1984-03-06 11:23:57"
"262","87","385","3","Thanks to eight years in Vin Santo's traditional caratelli barrels, this sweet blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia offers a dark, golden-amber color, bearing intense aromas of dried apricot, candied fruit, honey and toasted almond.","1985-08-27 15:07:29"

"985","78","386","0","Just one barrel was produced from the own-rooted vines planted almost 50 years ago. It's earthy and scented with a menthol/eucalyptus note, that carries on through. Cranberry flavor reflects the rather low alcohol, but there is no hint of unripeness or any vegetative character.","1978-10-05 20:54:43"
"421","98","883","1","The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it structure and aging potential. It is a ripe wine that is also stylish with attractive acidity and plenty of black-currant fruitiness. The wine is developing well and it should be ready to drink from 2018.","2013-06-03 02:16:53"

"836","32","533","2","This is the second wine from one of the group of chateaus with Corbin in their names.

"383","41","849","4","All from Rosebud Vineyard, this moderately aromatic wine brings notes of herbs and pineapple, with S√©millon (15%) adding fig to the mix. The concentration doesn't seem all there and it needs a bit more acid to stand it up.","2020-10-21 21:15:29"

An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured.","1989-12-18 00:05:09"
"1407","69","620","3","This is an amazingly tasty and focused wine that has the most distinctive black pepper character. It's medium-bodied, dark and smoky looking and quite flavorful, backing up the pepper with lively raspberry notes and staying lively from the first sip to the last.","2015-07-14 18:54:27"
"635","29","802","0","Chocolate and blackberry form an impressively generous and full-bodied personality in this 100% varietal wine aged 22 months in a hearty percentage of new oak. Big tannin and traces of cigar and espresso continue on the brawny theme.","2012-09-13 03:19:23"
"1481","14","271","0","Not such a rarity these days, Albari√±o is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white.","1999-10-09 20:09:09"

"1068","9","88","3","The latest release from the partnership between the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro and the Cazes family of Ch√¢teau Lynch-Bages in Bordeaux. The wine brings out considerable minerality, a herbal edge along with forward black currant fruit. It is austerely structured at this stage and needs aging for several years.","1970-08-04 03:38:38"
"1983","7","571","4","Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.","1981-06-22 12:13:32"
"1080","48","686","0","Here's an elegant and clean blend of Merlot (50%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from coastal Tuscany that offers intensity and well-measured aromas of ripe cherry, espresso bean and tobacco.

"1507","23","203","2","A solid effort, with attractive, balanced black currant fruits and ripe acidity. The wine layers fruit and integrated tannins. It feels chunky and dense, finishing dry.","2018-07-14 03:55:42"
"266","49","231","0","Impressive for its depth and deliciousness. The grapes are from Cline's estate on the Sonoma side of the Carneros district. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, although you can drink it now. It's very rich in blackberries, currants, mushu plum sauce, grilled beef and smoky sandalwood, and seems at its best now.","2006-06-06 03:08:42"
"1867","86","847","1","Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous. Feels tight, gritty and healthy, with firm tannins in front of black cherry and blackberry flavors. Mellows on the finish, where plum and prune flavors take over. Not a hard, fierce Priorat; drink now through 2014.","1985-05-31 07:36:01"
"236","55","408","1","Here's a big, rich, fruity Cabernet that satisfies for its array of blackberry, cherry, currant, mineral and oak flavors. It's dry and tannic, and the overall quality is quite high. The price makes it a good Buy. Drink through 2014","1996-06-28 17:16:13"

"641","64","443","4","Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined.","2010-02-20 12:10:30"
"1777","98","437","3","So soft, silky and sweet in blackberries, cherries and red currants, it could be a big, ripe Pinot Noir. That's a compliment. Petite Sirah can often be overpowering. This one's delicate, elegant and frankly delicious. Best now and over the next four years.","2001-02-21 22:08:48"
"1445","16","843","0","This Grenache-heavy blend (with 20% Syrah) offers a good amount of bittersweet cocoa powder and rich jammy black berries and all-fruit preserves on the nose and mouth. A hint of gaminess adds interest to the bouquet, while the crushed velvet texture and firm tannins transition into a long finish laced with earthy spice.","2017-03-19 14:08:09"
"47","77","323","1","Aromas of fresh-cut hay lead to a wine that has considerable concentration and good balance from wood aging. Very citrus with pineapple touches, it finishes with an herbaceous feel. The wine comes from a vineyard planted at the end of the 19th century.","1994-02-05 05:13:20"

"300","15","491","5","If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you. It's an explosion of tangerines, golden mangoes, peaches and pears, with buttery, creamy overtones and a finish of honey. Lots of zesty acidity adds a balancing scour to the mouthfeel.","1999-12-03 21:59:23"
"1972","70","750","0","Delicious is the word that comes to mind drinking this Pinot Noir. It's young and vibrant in acidity, with waves of raspberries, persimmons, honey, cinnamon, cloves and smoky sandalwood. Good over the next five years.","2018-03-12 21:16:29"
"766","37","335","3","A riot of licorice, cassis, toast and berry, this 83% Cabernet Sauvignon/17% Petit Verdot Bordeaux-style blend is currently showing a lot of barrel flavors, with subdued but not insignificant fruit. Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas.","1986-01-27 00:49:28"

"962","30","51","2","Le Buche is an interesting winery to watch, and its various Tuscan blends show great promise. Memento is equal parts Sangiovese and Syrah with a soft, velvety texture and a bright berry finish.","2016-08-14 18:10:38"
"30","8","878","0","Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive.","1981-10-30 16:16:51"
"790","86","738","5","Dusty and tight, with a whiff of coffee and cocoa introducing an elegant wine with interesting streaks of metal and graphite. Young fruit and fine tannins are in perfect balance, and the wine has a lovely delicacy.","1970-09-27 00:05:23"
"1575","35","97","0","This vintage of Marsiliana (the top wine from the Maremma property of Prince Corsini) shows rich tones of espresso, chocolate, dark fruit, leather and spice. The wine is soft and well extracted, with a slightly tough, chewy finish.","1973-05-10 07:31:08"

Drink now through 2014.","1975-12-24 23:25:42"
"191","26","167","0","A wood-aged white, spicy and ripe. It has just the right balance of acidity to go with the ripe green plum and melon fruits. With a great bite of acidity to finish, this is a wine that will age for 3‚Äì4 years.","1973-02-03 06:03:31"
"302","57","441","0","White lily, popcorn kernel, citrus spray and underripe peach lead the well-integrated and restrained nose. The palate follows suit, remaining quiet and delicate in flavor concentration, yet loud in weight and texture. Salty citrus lingers on the finish.","1999-12-04 16:00:45"

"1942","52","767","4","Aromas of leather, vineyard dust, dried violet and a whiff of pressed powder lead the nose. The simple palate isn't very expressive, showing sour red cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside close-grained tannins that dry out the finish.","1996-03-30 16:55:50"

"1746","80","600","4","Peach, canned tropical fruit and white flower aromas are pristine on the nose.

"957","33","430","0","A fresh lemon-flavored wine with crisp acidity balanced by warmer white-stone fruit. It is fruity, showing a touch of toast and almonds. Drink now.","1994-03-31 17:09:28"
"1567","10","76","4","The nose isn't very expressive, offering aromas of toasted hazelnut, while the dense, simple palate shows dried black cherry and licorice. It's shy on freshness and has round but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2018.","1976-11-22 02:41:26"
